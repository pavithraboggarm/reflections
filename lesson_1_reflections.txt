How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Helped me find the difference very soon without consuming time

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Helps me track the chamges i have made.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: less number of versions and are saved with messages
    cons: we might miss out on major commits as it ha sto be done manually

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    So that they go along
    
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log gives in all the changes made along with the commit ids and the corresponding messages to indicat ethe change made
    git diff can be used for finding the diffenrence between two commit ids

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    so that i will the back up of my code.
    
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    version control of my code
