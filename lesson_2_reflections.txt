What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git folder is created
untracked files are under list
we are on the master

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

its is tracked but it is not committed to git
helps us to track and update us on the commitment into git
