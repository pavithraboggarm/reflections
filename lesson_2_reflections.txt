What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git folder is created
untracked files are under list
we are on the master

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

its is tracked but it is not committed to git
helps us to track and update us on the commitment into git

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

git diff  and git diff --staged helps us to make sure it has just the required changes for the committment
git diff compares working directory and staged 
git diff -- staged compares staged and repository

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When we need to make new feature additions, but retain the working code
some changes which go on the same work code, but the bahavior remains the same like language change
